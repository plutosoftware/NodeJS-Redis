# NodeJS Redis - Caching 

Redis is in memory data base which is used to store data into computer RAM for faster access of the data. As the data is in the RAM itself, the backend server doesn't need to call database for the data, and can directly send the data from the RAM.

Thus, introducing caching with redis, increases the performance of the application to large extent.
